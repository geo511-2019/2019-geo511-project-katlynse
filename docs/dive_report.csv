0.62569444444444444,15761,10358,1808,,We have reached the bottom:  sedimented pillows and lobes,
0.62708333333333333,15773,10378,1815,,"Bruce has put the sub down right at a contact.  The sub is resting on sedimented lobes.  There are broad areas of <1 m that are covered with sediment, so ""coalesced pockets of sediment.  And we're facing a small lobate mound.  Tightly packed lobes and pillows.  The slope in front of me is about a 30° slope or so, mostly lobes that are a few tens of cm. across with sediment in the pockets.",
0.63124999999999998,15682,10390,1809,,"There's a strong current pushing us to the NW.  We've nestled on the edge of this slope of pillows and lobes.  There's a consistent dusting of sediment on top of everything, but I can see through the sediment on top of the lobes.  There's enough small-scale topography on the surface that I can't really see any sediment pockets cuz there's just no place for the pockets.  Looks like there's some Mg on the rocks, and there're lots of little cessile creatures growing on the rocks as well.",Sample #1
0.63402777777777775,15782,10396,1806,,"On this pillow mound with a dusting of sediment.  We got sample #1 which is part of a lobe; not exactly a bud, just a protuberance.  We were able to get photos of where it was, and there's a lot of orange staining in the interior of the rock.",
0.63611111111111118,15783,10361,,,We're gonna do a sonar spin here.,
0.63402777777777775,15752,10354,,,We're about 15 m off the ground to do a sonar spin.,
0.64097222222222217,15745,10384,1814,,Sedimented pillows and lobes; a van Andel 3 or 4.  Sediment everywhere with regions of up to 1 meter across that are just blankets of sediment.  I've asked Bruce to find a sample.,
0.64513888888888882,15731,10373,1817,,"Bruce has collected a sample of a pillow bud from this heavily sedimented terrain.  There's a coating of sediment over everything; can't really see through it.  On tops of the pillows there's sponges and things growing on tops of the pillows.  This corresponds to the ""heavy/coalescent"" stuff we've been seeing on towcam.",Sample #2
0.6479166666666667,15732,10373,1816,,"After collecting the 2nd sample, we are bypassing waypoint 1, and we're going to head to waypoint 2.  We anticipate crossing the contact again, between the heavily sedimented, flat-lying, primarily lobes with a few pillows--there's a very long pillow, longer than the sub, with an aspect ratio of about 5 on this flat terrain, which is kinda interesting--back over that lobate hill.",
0.65000000000000002,15795,10315,1815,,"We're climbing up a hill, but it's still sedimented.",
0.65208333333333335,15820,10289,1805,,More lobes; we've kindof reached a [topographic] shoulder here.  Still looks like the same sedimented terrain.  Some of the individual lobes are collapsed.  An interesting combination of a collapse and something that never filled in in the first place.,
0.65416666666666667,15877,10231,1807,,"Coming uphill.  The sediment pockets are becoming smaller as we go up this hill.  There's still a sediment coating on the pillows.  I think what we're seeing rather than a contact is the nature of the sediment cover:  because we're on a slope, the pockets of sediment are smaller.",
0.65625,15909,10197,1789,137,There's a large fissure about 2m wide.  We're crossing it now; it's running at about N45W from the sub heading.  Broken pillows--beautifully broken pillows at the top; can't see the bottom.,
0.65833333333333333,15975,10135,1795,,Climbing up the first [topographic] shoulder [on our planned dive track].  It's a constructional slope; it's sedimented; there are lobes and pillows.  There are still large pockets of sediment.  I don't think it's any younger than the stuff we've been flying over.,
0.66041666666666665,16004,10105,1717,,"Reached the top of this first large shoulder.  The whole thing looked like it was the same age.  Sedimented.  Now that we're at the top, there are broad areas 2 m across or more of flat blanket sediment and pillows <1 m.  We're gonna head off to waypoint 3 now.",
0.66249999999999998,15974,10044,,211,"Crossing over a fault that steps down, and it's dipping from in front of the sub to behind the sub, and steps down a couple of meters.",
0.67013888888888884,,,,,"There are some nav problems related to communication between the sub and the ship, so we're holding tight 'til we get a good fix.",
0.6743055555555556,,,,,Moving on to waypoint 3; still over these sedimented lobes and pillows.,
0.6777777777777777,16241,9589,1752,,"Climbiing up this hill of sedimented lobes and pillows on our way to waypoint 3.  This still has broad patches of sediment that are 2, 3, 4 meters across with pillows and lobes sticking out of it; still a constructional slope.",
0.67986111111111114,16168,9548,1735,,"Passing over a break in slope; it was a flat area, and in that area, the lobes were very broad and flat, a couple of meters across with minimal releif but no change in the sediment cover.  Bruce sees a fissure coming up; I see it in the camera.  A couple of meters deep.",
,,,,,"We're crossing a fissure that's about N40W, it's about 4 m wide.  There are broken pillows on the floor of it; some of them look like they might be in place but it's hard to tell.",
0.68263888888888891,16134,9521,1734,,"We crossed over a 2-m-wide fissure very close to the summit of this shoulder that houses waypoint #3.  And the flow direction on either side of the fissure looked like the lobes were flowing away from the fissure so Bruce is nestling up against the fissure to grab a rock.  These rocks look slightly less sedimented than the other stuff we've been flying over, but not drastically.",
0.69027777777777777,16140,9536,1733,152,"Fissure is roughly parallel to sub heading.  Bruce did a great job of getting a piece of pillow crust right from the lip of the fissure.  It looked like at that point that the lobes and pillows were locally flowing away from the fissure.  It does look like some of the pillows and lobes may be in place at the base of the fissure, but there's definitely some broken pillows on the wall of the fissure, so this may be one of those ""syn-eruptive fissures.""",Sample #3
0.69513888888888886,16066,9498,1735,,"Sedimented lobes and pillows still, although right here the sediment pockets are smaller:  they're a few tens of centimeters across.  And there's maybe a little bit less sediment on top of the lobes and pillows as well.",
0.69652777777777775,16016,9476,1739,,"Sedimented lobes and pillows, and now the sediment pockets are a couple of meters wide as we cruise up this hill towards…  I think what's happening is that we're nearing the top of this plateau this shoulder that contains waypoint 3, and the slope is governing how much sediment we see between the lobes and pillows.",
0.69861111111111107,15931,9432,1728,,"Climbing up the shoulder to waypoint 3 and it's a constructional slope with lobes and pillows.  Sediment cover may be a little less, but of course we're also climbing up a slope.",
0.7006944444444444,15866,9401,,,"We crossed out of the tightly packed pillows and lobes and back into broad sediment pockets that were a couple of meters across.  Ithink that's primarily controlled by topography, though, because I haven't seen anything that looks strongly like a contact.  In places the sediment is covered with broken glass, making the sediment look dark.",
0.70208333333333339,15806,9370,1715,,Out my window to the left there's a collapse in this lobate flow that's at least a couple of sublengths long.  It's the largest collapse I've seen in this neck of the woods so far.  So we're out of the pillows and into lobate flows which is kinda surprising but the slope is a pretty gentle slope as we go up.  There's a nice hole; oh that's definitly a lava tube!  There's stalagtites and everything!  It's about 2 m across!,
0.70347222222222217,15770,9352,1713,,There's a jumbled sheet flow on our way up this shoulder and Bruce has stopped to get a rock.,Sample #4
0.7090277777777777,15769,9351,1713,,We're going to head toward waypoint #4 after collecting a sample of this jumbled sheet flow.  Handful of glass and a piece that went into 7D.,
0.7104166666666667,15753,9343,1710,,"As we climb up this slope there is beautiful hackly, jumbled texture; Bruce says he sees a crack coming up.  I can still see the lobate form of the jumbled texture; they're not channels.  Oh, but right below me [gasp!] those fractures are filled in with dribbles of lava, so those fractures formed when the lava was still squishy.  They're small fractures, just a few tens of cm across and a few tens of cm deep.",
0.71180555555555547,15712,9315,1706,,"As we continue to fly up this jumbled texture there are lots of small hoels that we pass over a couple of meters across, <1 m deep.  One that I saw was in the bottom of a  much larger hole, like an ant-lion thing.  And some of those holes look like lava was coming out of them; we just passed one that looked like a standard collapse feature.  Bruce says he sees lobates, but I still have lobates out my window...  And now I see lobates as well, so we just crossed a little contact",
0.71250000000000002,15700,9301,1706,,contact between jumbled and lobate.  Broad lobates; pockets of sediment between the lobes; some collapses.,
0.71319444444444446,15688,9285,1706,,"As we continue up this slope, there are patches of the jumbled texture amidst these more flattened lobes.  Now out my window I see, it looks more like broken up lobes rather than jumbled lobes.  There are like puzzle-pieces of the lobate crust.  And there's a collapse in which I can see 4 layers, which is kinda cool.",
0.71458333333333324,15655,9247,1705,219,"We passed a couple of streams of lava; I'm not going to call them channels because they're not that big.  The streams were pretty much perpendicular, flowing from the port to the starboard, from the left to the right, and now we're back into sedimented pillows and--mostly pillows.  We also passed a region back there where the lobes, each individual lobe was collapsed by a few centimeters.",
0.71666666666666667,15658,9180,1701,154,"We're going from, we took a turn heading toward waypoint #5 and we just passed over a cliff that dropped off in front of us.  The cliff was 3 m or so high, and now we're over jumbled sheet flows.",
0.71805555555555556,15678,9158,1704,,"Large orange anemone that's bent over--is that from the current?  Broad lobes, same kind of sediment cover, consistent sediment cover with pockets of sediment between them.  Pillows as we climb up toward waypoint #5.",
0.72083333333333333,15737,9080,,152,"We were climbing up this hill of pillows and lobes and then suddenly there was a fissure about 2 - 3 m wide, it's offset in front of the sub, had to climb up about 8 meters.  The wall is broken pillows, roughly perpendicular to our heading.",
0.72291666666666676,15785,9032,1796,142,"Climbing up this shoulder of pillows that is, this shoulder that contains waypoint #5 that I think is attached to the seamount, and there's no obvious difference between this stuff and the stuff we've been climbing over.  It might look a little bit, if I squint, I can sort of convince myself that there's less sediment on top of the pillows, but there's still pockets of sediment between the pillows.",
0.72638888888888886,15830,974,1655,,"We're climbing up this shoulder of the seamount; it is primarily pillows and lobes.  Every once in a while you see an individual pillow or lobe that's collapsed a few centimters.  Sediment pockets inbetween.  The aspect ratio of some of the pillows is like 3 or 4, but many of them are just nice bulbous pillows a meter or so high.",
0.72986111111111107,15840,8955,1648,,"We just collected sample #5.  It's a couple of pieces of lobate crust that I'm confident is from the shoulder of the large seamount.  As we continue to go up, there's less sediment, more coral, and I'm confident that the rock you picked is from the same stuff.  It's a forest of coral, with starfish hanging from them.",Sample #5
0.73055555555555562,15846,8942,1646,,"We're crossing over a fault, stepping down in front of the sub.  It's about 4 m high.  Really large lobes and pillows exposed in the wall of the fissure from this side.  Meters across, 2-3m across lobes and pillows.  And they're not broken, they're squishy.  Yup, I'm not seeing broken pillows; it looks like there are lobes that blobbled down that fault.",
0.73263888888888884,15839,8878,,134,"We're climbing up this hill of lightly sedimented lobes of pillows with aspect ratios of 1 - 2.  The pillows are meter-scale.  Fuzz on all the rocks, but not a lot of sediment.  I can see through to the rock.  It's not glassy, but it does look younger.  I still think this is the same stuff you got a rock of [sample#5].",
0.73472222222222217,15901,8858,1630,,"We didn't quite go to waypoint #5 but we don't need to, so we're going to head for waypoint #6.  We're coming off this shoulder of the seamount and starting to climb up the seamount. It's still all sedimented pillows and lobes, but very light sediment cover, sediment is just in the pockets.  There's a dusting of sediment on top, but no glass.  So not a lot of sediment but this was not yesterday's eruption.",
0.73749999999999993,15932,8806,1630,,"Flying over these very lightly sedimented pillows and lobes.  Some of the pillows are quite large, almost 2m.  Most of them are not; most are on the meter scale.",

These have a little bit more sediment on top of them than we saw on the shoulder,and in the pockets.  The morphology's very very similar.  Just a slight more sediment cover on the tops of the pillows and lobes.",
0.7402777777777777,,,,,"An added note:  the pillows and lobes are flowing from in front of the sub to behind the sub, so they definitely are coming from the seamount.",

Sediment consistent:  there's a dusting of sediment over everything, and in pockets, but I can see through the sediment when it's on the top in most cases (but not always) on all the pillows.  Some individual lobes are collapsed, and some of the individual pillows are fractured in such a way that you can see layers on either side of the fracture.  You can see what looks like pulsed emplacement of the lava, pushing the crust outward.",

The collapses tend to be still the sizes of individual lobes, but we did pass over a hole that was so deep I couldn't see the bottom of it.  And out my window there is...  Is that a fault?  There's a large collapse with what looks like hydrothermal staining on the walls.  That looks kinda 9-northy over there.  It's a copule of meters deep, and in the collapses I can see layers, look kinda like bathtub rings, but I think they're layers inside.",
